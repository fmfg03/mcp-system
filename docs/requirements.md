# MCP System Requirements Analysis

## Overview
The Multi-Client Protocol (MCP) system is designed to facilitate collaborative website development using two LLMs (Claude and ChatGPT) as autonomous agents. One LLM acts as the Builder, proposing structure and code, while the other acts as the Judge, reviewing and critiquing the Builder's work.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Management
- Support for two LLM agents (Claude and ChatGPT)
- Dynamic role assignment (Builder/Judge)
- Role switching capability
- Persistent memory/thread history for each agent

### 2. Memory Management
- Persistent storage of conversation history
- Token optimization strategies
- Summarization of previous interactions
- Memory anchors for key project details

### 3. User Interface
- Project initialization interface
- Agent interaction panel
- Role switching controls
- Project status dashboard

### 4. Website Development Tools
- File structure generation
- Code generation and storage
- Asset management
- Deployment suggestions

## Website Project Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Pages: Home, About, Services/Products, Contact, Blog/Resources, Privacy Policy, FAQ
- Components: Header, footer, nav bar, hero section, CTAs, forms, testimonials, feature cards
- Content: AI-generated text, headings, metadata, FAQs

- Optional: GitHub repo instructions, CI/CD setup

## System Architecture Considerations
- Server-side vs. client-side implementation
- API integration for LLM services
- Memory storage solutions
- Token budget management
- Error handling and recovery
